or

It seems there are some very impressive water falls in Rochester, e.g.

Maybe a fearless tikzduck could swim there? 




## CTAN praise

A celebration of the CTAN team would be awesome, perhaps an office and a 
duck or another tikzling with those phone headsets and a computer to 
symbolize support... Then a huge gift with a card "with love, the LaTeX3 

I like Paulo's idea to make an office with computer etc. Maybe one could even 
add a tiny conveyor belt that runs into the computer with lots of ordinary 
brown packages and then a big and colourful L3 package between them. This 
could even use the cool duck gift paper from Ulrike  

Title "CTAN factory".  Packages that run into the computer and come out again 
as colorful packages would be nice.
